# MachineLearning-Basics
A collection of Python scripts demonstrating the simple functionality of Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms.

 --Key steps such as weight initiation, activation function, error calculation and Back Propagation are broken down in the Neural Network script.
 -- **NEURAL NETWORK SERVES TO MULTIPLY TWO NUMBERS TOGETHER**

 --Key genetic algorithm ideas are covered too, such as: population initiation, crossover function, offspring and a roulette selection function.
 -- **GENETIC ALGORITHM SERVES TO EVALUATE A POPULATION OF BINARY STRINGS (0s & 1s) TO ALL ONLY CONTAIN 1s**

-- Both scripts can be easily adapted for other simple problems
