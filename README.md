# MachineLearning-Basics
A collection of Python scripts demonstrating the simple functionality of Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms.

 --Key steps such as weight initiation, activation function, error calculation and Back Propagation are broken down in the Neural Network script.

 --Key genetic algorithm ideas are covered too, such as: population initiation, crossover function, offspring and a roulette selection function.
